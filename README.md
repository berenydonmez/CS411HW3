OLD REPO: https://github.com/berenydonmez/homework3berenandjason/tree/main

We had this OLD REPO then we had an issue with main branch , opened a new branch with the latest code but then we realized our smoke tests werent funcitoning
So I created this new repo fixing the error that is why there is only 1 commit
I am also attaching the smoketest working on my computer in here for reference,
